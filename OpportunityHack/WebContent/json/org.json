"about":"Two friends Reefath Rajali and Gopinath Desam decided to start Saburi Charitable Organization for supporting the education of under-privileged kids in India. They registered the organization with the city of San Jose, CA in 2013. They got the approval for this organization from the State of California in 2014. Saburi Charitable Foundation became a 501(c)3 registered non-profit in San Jose in 2014.",
"mission":" The purpose of the education is to turn mirrors into windows.When you look into a mirror it only shows you and inside of the building confining you and your thoughts. However if you make the mirror into a window you can look and see the world and open your minds to all the vast knowledge thatâ€™s out there. By establishing this non-profit organization we believe we could achieve the motto and help kids look beyond their self."
